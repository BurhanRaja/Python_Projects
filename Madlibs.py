# The beginner project of Python - Madlib
# Let's make a string and add it to 'Read the ______ by ______'

# blog = ''
# name = ''

# # Now writing the string, there are three ways to print the string
# print('Read the '+blog+' by '+name)
# print('Read the {} by {}'.format(blog, name))
# print(f'Read the {blog} by {name}')

# The Output will be like below:
# Read the  by 
# Read the  by 
# Read the  by 

# Now doing the Madlibs Project

fav = input('')
phrase = input('')
start = input('')
dream = input('')
field = input('')

# Change the Phrase according to your liking
print(f'{fav} is my favourite thing in this world. I love {phrase} everyday. I started my career by doing {start}. It is my dream to become {dream}. I am also willing to work in {field}.')

# This will be your output according to your input format:

# Programming
# to write
# Web Development
# Data Science or Computer Vision engineer or do something in the field of AI
# Autonomous Vehicles
# Programming is my favourite thing in this world. I love to write everyday. I started my career by doing Web Development. It is my dream to become Data Science or AI master. I am also willing to work in Autonomous Vehicles.
